About Honeyd:
-------------

Honeyd is a small daemon that creates virtual hosts on a network.  The
hosts can be configured to run arbitrary services, and their TCP
personality can be adapted so that they appear to be running certain
versions of operating systems.  Honeyd enables a single host to claim
multiple addresses - I have tested up to 65536 - on a LAN for network
simulation.

It is possible to ping the virtual machines, or to traceroute them.
Any type of service on the virtual machine can be simulated according
to a simple configuration file.  Instead of simulating a service, it
is also possible to proxy it to another machine.

Installation:
-------------

Honeyd depends on several libraries:

 - libevent  - event notification
 - libdnet   - packet creation
 - libpcap   - packet sniffing
 - libdnsres - non-blocking DNS resolver
 - libpcre   - perl regular expression library

Make sure that you have them installed.

For the regression framework to run, you need to install the Python
module for libdnet.  You might need Python 2.4 for the best results.

To build honeyd, run the following commands:

$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install

If your compilation stops due to Python related errors, you can try to
run configure as

$ ./configure --without-python

If you get compilation warnings on Linux bitch to the people responsible
for the conditional header file idioticy.

Documentation:
--------------

You can find documentation as part of this release.  The manual
page can be accessed with the following commands:

$ man honeyd

or in the source directory

$ nroff -mdoc honeyd.8

More information can be found at http://www.honeyd.org/

Running:
--------

Honeyd requires root-privileges for execution.  Normally, you run it
with arguments similiar to the following:

$ sudo ./honeyd -d -f config.sample 10.0.0.0/8

It is strongly recommend that you run Honeyd in a chroot environment
under a sandbox like systrace.  If possible, Honeyd drops privileges
after creating its raw sockets.  This depends on your configuration
file.  You can force privileges to be dropped by setting Honeyd's uid
and gid via the -u <uid> and -g <gid> flags.
